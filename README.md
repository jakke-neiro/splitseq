## 4. Round 1: Reverse transcription
The round 1 barcode binds to the polyadenylation tail of mRNA. The Round 1 barcode has a 15 base T-tail binding to the polyA-tail and two nonbinding bases (NV). N is any base (A, C, G, or T), and V is A,C or G.

We use the Maxima H Minus RT enzyme to perform reverse transcription or "first strand synthesis". The Maxima H Minus RT enzyme is derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV). During first-strand synthesis, upon reaching the 5' end of the RNA template. the terminal transferase activity of the MMLV reverse transcriptase adds a few additional nucleotides (mostly deoxycytidine) to the 3' end of the newly synthesized cDNA strand. These bases function later as a template-switch (TS) oligo-anchoring site.

We now have a mRNA/DNA chimera:

We have to pay attention to RNAses and DNAses

## 5. Round 2: Ligation 1
Ligation is performed with the T4 DNA Ligase. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond between juxtaposed 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxyl termini in duplex DNA or RNA. 

2ml ligation mix: 500 ul T4 Lugase Buffer 10x + 100 ul T4 DNA ligase + 1500 water.

A blocking solution is prepared with Blocker_1. Blocker_1 is complementary to Linker_1.
